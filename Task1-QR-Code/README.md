## My process
I thought it would be easier for me to do,it wasnt hard but took me longer then i expected,
had to search for some css styiling.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnd media Queries thought i could use responsive styiling whith this project, but as it came out i didnt needed to set any extra @media stylng for this task.

### Continued development

in future projects i would like to use more of responive desiging and develop myself to get eady for harder tasks.
